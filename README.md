Basic info
Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in our world, and they reproduce more than any human ever has.

Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit and cottontail rabbits. The other rabbit species, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male rabbit is called a buck and the female rabbit is a doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit (confusingly!).

Little Bunny Foo Foo,
I don't want to see you
scooping up the field mice
and bopping them on the head!
